                    Thanks for your letter.
                    I think I’ll be leaving here on Thursday, 25 or Saturday, 27 June, if nothing unforeseen happens. I’m longing so much to see everyone and Holland. I’m also looking forward to having a good talk with you about art, start thinking about any questions you might want to put to me.
                    We have many beautiful things here, including a spirited painting by Jacquet, and a beautiful Boldini...</p>
